PERSONAL
========

 I love music, cooking, popular science and occasional sailing.  I study Japanese and hold grade 2 in the Japanese Language Proficiency Test. I really enjoy spending time with my sons, teaching myself new things, and working on personal coding projects. I taught myself programming with Swift and Ruby on Rails and I run a monthly meet-up for programmers in my area called [Osaka Coffee and Coding](https://www.meetup.com/Osaka-Coffee-and-Coding/)
